        <h2>Why did I create these apps? 🤔</h2>
        <p>Throughout my career working on large-scale applications at companies like Ounass and Textalk, I've seen how enterprise priorities can sometimes overshadow user needs. While building features for millions of users, I realized that the most impactful solutions come from deeply understanding real problems.</p>
        <p>My apps—Walk Mate, EV Charge Stations Map, and Travel Route Map—are born from challenges I faced personally. Whether it's finding new walking routes, locating EV chargers during road trips, or sharing travel adventures, these apps solve problems I encountered in my daily life. This personal connection ensures I'm building tools that genuinely improve user experience, not just checking off business requirements.</p>

      <div class="about-section">
        <h2>How do I develop apps? 🖥️</h2>
        <p>I leverage my professional experience with Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, and modern iOS architecture patterns (MVVM, Combine, Swift Concurrency) to build polished, production-ready apps. Each app follows iOS Human Interface Guidelines and incorporates best practices I've learned from working on enterprise applications—proper testing, performance optimization, and accessibility support.</p>
        <p>Apple's ecosystem allows me to focus on what matters: crafting exceptional user experiences. Privacy is paramount—I don't collect user data. Instead, I rely on App Store reviews and direct feedback to iterate and improve. By maintaining full control over the development process, I can quickly respond to user needs and continuously enhance the apps based on real-world usage.</p>

        <h2>Let's connect! 👋</h2>
        <p>If you're using one of my apps, I'd love to hear your thoughts! App Store reviews help me reach more people and guide future improvements. For questions, suggestions, or just to connect, reach out via <a href="https://github.com/emrdgrmnci" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> or connect with me on <a href="https://x.com/emrdgrmnci" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter/X</a>.
